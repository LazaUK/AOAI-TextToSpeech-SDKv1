# Text-to-Speech generation with Azure OpenAI TTS
_tts-1_ and _tts-1-hd_ are Text-to-Speech models from OpenAI, which can produce audio content based on your textual input (prompt). You will find a Jupyter notebook in this repo, that utilises Azure OpenAI deployment of tts-1 to generate MP3 audio for a given textual menu content.

To build this demo, I used the latest version of OpenAI Python SDK - v1.x. To upgrade your _openai_ Python package, please use the following pip command:
```
pip install --upgrade openai
```
